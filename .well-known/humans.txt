/* PROJECT */

Name: llm-antidote
Description: Universal semantic reset artifacts for language model context management
Version: 1.0.0
License: CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)
Repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/llm-antidote

Philosophy: Minimalism, User Agency, Cross-Platform, Educational Focus

Artifacts: 10 reset variants (Scheme, Python, JS, JSON + specialized)
Tools: 5 professional utilities (CLI, diagnostic, verification, test, benchmark)
Documentation: 12+ comprehensive guides and research papers
Research: Cross-model effectiveness study (7 LLM platforms)

/* ACKNOWLEDGMENTS */

This project explores the boundaries of LLM context management through
minimal, symbolic interventions. It represents research into user agency,
conversational control, and the behavioral patterns of large language models.

Special thanks to the AI research community for advancing our understanding
of these systems, and to the open-source community for creating the tools
and platforms that make this work possible.

The llm-antidote project is a testament to what can be accomplished through
autonomous AI-assisted development when given clear objectives and creative
freedom. This repository was substantially developed by Claude Code in a
single autonomous session, demonstrating the potential for human-AI
collaboration in software development.
